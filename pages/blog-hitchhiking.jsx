          Hitchhiking has always been about the spirit of adventure, meeting new
          people, and embarking on unpredictable journeys. But what if you could
          bring a touch of predictability and safety without compromising the
          thrill? The "Chat on the Map" service is here to transform hitchhiking
          for the modern adventurer.

          How can "Chat on the Map" enhance hitchhiking?

        <div className={styles.text}>
          Through the platform, travelers can drop messages on their intended
          route, indicating their hitchhiking intentions. Potential drivers,
          familiar with the route, can then reach out, offering a ride for a
          portion or the entirety of the journey. It's a way to pre-plan while
          maintaining the spontaneous essence of hitchhiking.

        <div className={styles.text}>
          One of the biggest concerns with hitchhiking is safety. Plus, sharing
          your journey intentions with a community can provide an added layer of
          security and peace of mind.
