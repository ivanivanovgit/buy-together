          Many of us have daily routes that we religiously follow – whether it's
          commuting to work, dropping kids at school, or any other routine. What
          if you could make these journeys more worthwhile, not just in terms of
          time but also financially? The "Chat on the Map" service now allows
          you to do just that!

          With the "Chat on the Map" platform, users can add their regular
          routes under the "Routes" tab. It could be a package that needs
          dropping off halfway through your journey or a parcel heading in the
          same direction as your workplace. The choice is yours on whether you'd
          like to take up the task or not.
